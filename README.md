# CMHD
Compact representation of Multidimensional data on Hierarchical Domains

This repository is an attemp to implement a generalized form of the CMHD
data structure presented and explainted in this papers:

- https://dsi.face.ubiobio.cl/mcaniupan/pdfs/SCCC2018CamReady.pdf

# Motivation

This type of structure have a great impact in the way that systems could 
represent and expose diferent views of the same data. In both papers; a 
two-dimensional data structure is discussed with examples; it's 
my aim to implement a succint n-dimensional data structure such that it serves
as open-source documentation of this type of structures and as a dependency for
my detlqav project.

# Why F#?

F# is a mature, open source, cross-platform, strongly typed, functional-first 
programming language. It's compact, expressive, explicit and I love the way 
data is represented and queried in it.
